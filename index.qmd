Many people continue to have high expections of what data & AI can bring. Yet, the majority of organizations struggle to capture real value from  data and AI-driven innovations. Studies have shown that up to 95% of such innovations never make it past the proof-of-concept stage into full-scale operations.

The key towards creating sustainable change with digital technologies lies in increasing your the data literacy of yourself and your organization, such that applications of AI can be developed in the right context. How? Read on.

### Data-centric AI

Data sit at the core of digital business transformation. As machine learning algorithms mature, the biggest challenge in making AI work is to improve the quality and scale of the data required to train AI. In our experience most AI projects fail because existing data platforms lack the reliability, flexibility and performance to effectively develop and deploy AI systems. We systematically engineer data so it can be used by AI systems. To improve your systems, drive innovation and enable data-based decision intelligence. We call that data-centric AI.

### Applied AI
The possibilities of AI are virtually endless and can fundamentally change the way you run your business or lead your organisation. It changes business strategies, policies as well as the behaviour of your teams. If your company embarks on integrating AI, it needs to do what is relevant and what you want it for. We developed impactful AI applications that are accurate. We take into account the factors that drive the predictions and relate it to physical systems and domain expertise. And help you transform and drive AI innovation in your services or products.

### Coaching & mentoring

Data and AI will fundamentally change your business, your organisation and your way of working. And not all employees or staff are immediately ready for this. We teach, coach and mentor professionals who require a better understanding of data and artificial intelligence. And make them both comfortable and topic-specialists. For larger audiences, we create workshops or provide key-note speakers so more and more professionals obtain a better understanding of data and AI.

:::{#about-me}
Dr Daniel Kapitan (1973) is a well-rounded data scientist and strategic advisor with years of experience in the field of data, machine learning and digital transformation. His knowledge can help companies to identify how to use AI, and how to integrate this into business processes, roles, and day-to-day operations. He aims to create sustainable change in organizations by systematically engineering data that is required for new AI applications.

With a PhD in physics from University of Oxford and currently Fellow at the Eindhoven AI Systems Institute (EAISI), Daniel has a strong scientific grounding in the field. He speaks authoritatively about data-driven transformation programs, reducing complexity to ‘informed simplicity’ for even the most challenging data projects. By combining data and AI know-how with industry expertise, he is capable of bringing about end-to-end business transformation for mid-sized companies, government organizations and scale-ups.

Daniel starts when organizations are ready to embark on their digital journey, and finishes when people are enabled to continue to work with data and AI by themselves.

### Roles
Daniel works as an advisor, architect, lecturer, applied researcher and mentor. He is one of the few specialists in the Netherlands who has the unique combination of corporate experience, scientific research and executive education. Through these various roles he aims to apply ‘AI for good’. He lectures on data and AI, publishes regularly and is an active member of the Data Sharing Coalition to foster data solidarity and secure data sharing for tackling societal issues.

### Areas of expertise
Explainable AI, physics-informed machine learning, data-centric AI, data architecture, federated learning, knowledge science, data commons.

### Industry focus
Healthcare, public sector, as well as scale-ups for which data and AI are a core element of their strategy.
