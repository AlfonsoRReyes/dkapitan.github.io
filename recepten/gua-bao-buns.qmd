The [original recipe](https://www.kitchensanctuary.com/gua-bao/) is quite elaborate: cooking pork belly, making the buns yourself. But this quick version using [ready-made buns](https://tokohoiyunrotterdam.wordpress.com/2020/12/13/lotus-leaf-bun-gao-bao-stoombroodjes/) and bacon cuts are almost as good.

## Ingredients

- 1 kg rindless bacon slices (speklappen)
- for the glazing
  - 2 tbsp vegetable oil
  - pinch salt and pepper
  - 1 tbsp minced ginger
  - 1 red chilli finely chopped
  - 2 tbsp honey
  - 2 tbsp brown sugar
  - 3 tbsp dark soy sauce
  - 1 tsp lemon grass paste
- 12 buns ([Happy Belly Lotus Leaf Bun](https://tokohoiyunrotterdam.wordpress.com/2020/12/13/lotus-leaf-bun-gao-bao-stoombroodjes/) package has 10, so make sure to buy 2)

## Instructions

- Cut the bacon in bite-size pieces. They can be quite chunky, but make sure it can fit in the bun
- Fry the bacon on medium heat first, such that the water and excess fat comes out. Pour out the fat (which I just through away)
- One the bacon has been reduced, you can turn up the heat to fry them to become crisp. I actually use a pan without teflon: if the bacon starts sticking, use a spatula to scrape it loose again. As you continue frying it, the caramalized fat will eventually create a coating
- While the bacon is frying, put together all the ingredients for the glazing
- Now pour the glaze over the pork and continue to cook until the pork looks dark and sticky - about 6-7 minutes. Turn off the heat and transfer to a warm bowl until you're ready to assemble the gua bao.
- Prepare the bao buns in a steamer according to the package instructions
