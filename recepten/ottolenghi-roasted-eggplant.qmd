## Ingredienten

- 4 medium eggplants (sliced into 3/4-inch rounds (2 lb 2 oz))
- Salt
- 7 tablespoons olive oil
- 6 anchovy fillets in oil (drained and finely chopped (about 1 tablespoon))
- 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
- 1 small garlic clove (crushed)
- Black pepper
- 1 tablespoon oregano leaves
- 1/4 cup parsley leaves (roughly chopped)

## Bereidingswijze

- Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
- Mix eggplant in a large bowl with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Transfer to 2 large parchment-lined baking sheets and then brush with 5 tablespoons of oil â€” you want it on both sides of the discs. Bake for 35 minutes, until dark golden brown and cooked through. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.
- In a small bowl, whisk together the anchovies, vinegar, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper. Slowly pour in the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil, whisking continuously, until combined.
- When ready to serve, finely chop the oregano and place in a large bowl along with the eggplant and parsley. Pour in the anchovy dressing, gently mix, and transfer to a platter or bowl.
